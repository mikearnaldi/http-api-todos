# GitHub Actions CI Pipeline - Feature Instructions

## Feature Overview

This feature implements a complete Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically run code quality checks and tests whenever code is pushed to the repository or pull requests are created.

## Why This Feature Is Needed

- **Code Quality Assurance**: Automatically enforce code quality standards across all contributions
- **Early Bug Detection**: Catch type errors, lint violations, and test failures before they reach main branch
- **Developer Experience**: Provide immediate feedback on code changes without manual intervention
- **Consistent Standards**: Ensure all code follows project conventions defined in CLAUDE.md

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want my code to be automatically checked for lint errors, type issues, and test failures when I push commits
- I want to receive clear feedback about any issues so I can fix them quickly
- I want the CI to run the same commands I use locally (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`)

### As a Project Maintainer
- I want all pull requests to pass quality checks before they can be merged
- I want consistent code quality enforcement across all contributors
- I want visibility into which commits pass or fail the CI pipeline

### As a Team Member
- I want to see the status of CI checks directly in GitHub pull requests
- I want failed checks to prevent accidental merges of broken code

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] CI pipeline triggers on push to any branch
- [ ] CI pipeline triggers on pull request creation/updates
- [ ] Pipeline runs `pnpm lint` and reports results
- [ ] Pipeline runs `pnpm typecheck` and reports results  
- [ ] Pipeline runs `pnpm test` and reports results
- [ ] All three checks must pass for the pipeline to succeed
- [ ] Failed checks prevent PR merges (when branch protection is enabled)

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Uses the same package manager as development (pnpm)
- [ ] Uses appropriate Node.js version for the project
- [ ] Installs dependencies before running checks
- [ ] Provides clear output for debugging failed checks
- [ ] Completes in reasonable time (under 5 minutes for typical changes)

### GitHub Integration
- [ ] Check results appear in GitHub PR interface
- [ ] Status badges show pass/fail state
- [ ] Failed checks include actionable error messages
- [ ] Pipeline status visible in commit history

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must use GitHub Actions (not other CI providers)
- Must use pnpm package manager (not npm or yarn)
- Must run the exact same commands as specified in CLAUDE.md
- Cannot modify existing package.json scripts or commands

### Project Constraints
- Should follow existing project patterns and conventions
- Must not interfere with local development workflow
- Should be cost-effective (use GitHub's free CI minutes efficiently)

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Project's package.json scripts (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`)
- Existing ESLint, TypeScript, and Vitest configurations
- Project's pnpm-lock.yaml for reproducible builds

### External Dependencies
- GitHub Actions platform
- Node.js runtime in GitHub's CI environment
- pnpm package manager availability in CI

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Included
- Deployment workflows (only CI, not CD)
- Multiple Node.js version testing (single version only)
- Performance benchmarking or coverage reporting
- Dependency security scanning
- Docker or containerization
- Integration with external services (Slack, email notifications, etc.)
- Windows or macOS runners (Linux only)
- Artifact publishing or release automation

### Future Considerations
These items may be added later but are not part of this initial feature:
- Code coverage reporting
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance regression testing
- Multiple environment testing (different Node.js versions)
- Deployment automation

## Success Metrics

- All existing project commands (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`) pass in CI
- Pipeline completes successfully on current main branch
- Clear pass/fail feedback visible in GitHub interface
- No false positives or unnecessary pipeline failures
- Consistent behavior between local development and CI environment
