# Specifications

This directory contains feature specifications following our spec-driven development approach.

## Structure

Each feature has its own directory containing:

- `instructions.md` - Initial feature requirements and user stories
- `requirements.md` - Detailed structured requirements 
- `design.md` - Technical design and implementation strategy
- `plan.md` - Implementation plan and progress tracking

## Workflow

1. **Specification Phase**: Create feature folder and document requirements/design
2. **Implementation Phase**: Follow design specifications and track progress
3. **Validation Phase**: Ensure implementation matches specifications

## Features
