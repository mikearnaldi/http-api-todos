# GitHub Actions CI Pipeline - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Automated Code Quality Checks
- **FR-1.1**: The CI pipeline MUST execute `pnpm lint` command
- **FR-1.2**: The CI pipeline MUST execute `pnpm typecheck` command  
- **FR-1.3**: The CI pipeline MUST execute `pnpm test` command
- **FR-1.4**: All three commands MUST pass for the pipeline to succeed
- **FR-1.5**: Failed commands MUST cause the pipeline to fail with clear error messages

### FR-2: Trigger Conditions
- **FR-2.1**: Pipeline MUST trigger on push to any branch
- **FR-2.2**: Pipeline MUST trigger on pull request creation
- **FR-2.3**: Pipeline MUST trigger on pull request updates (new commits)
- **FR-2.4**: Pipeline MUST NOT trigger on draft pull requests (optional optimization)

### FR-3: GitHub Integration
- **FR-3.1**: Check results MUST appear in GitHub pull request interface
- **FR-3.2**: Pipeline status MUST be visible in commit history
- **FR-3.3**: Failed checks MUST include actionable error output
- **FR-3.4**: Pipeline MUST support branch protection rules (when enabled)

### FR-4: Dependency Management
- **FR-4.1**: Pipeline MUST use pnpm package manager (not npm or yarn)
- **FR-4.2**: Pipeline MUST install dependencies before running checks
- **FR-4.3**: Pipeline MUST use frozen lockfile installation (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`)
- **FR-4.4**: Pipeline MUST cache dependencies between runs for performance

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- **NFR-1.1**: Complete pipeline MUST finish within 5 minutes for typical changes
- **NFR-1.2**: Dependency installation MUST be cached to reduce execution time
- **NFR-1.3**: Pipeline MUST use efficient resource allocation

### NFR-2: Reliability
- **NFR-2.1**: Pipeline MUST produce consistent results between runs
- **NFR-2.2**: Pipeline MUST handle temporary network failures gracefully
- **NFR-2.3**: Pipeline MUST use the same package versions as local development

### NFR-3: Maintainability
- **NFR-3.1**: Workflow configuration MUST be version controlled
- **NFR-3.2**: Workflow MUST be easily modifiable for future enhancements
- **NFR-3.3**: Node.js version MUST be configurable and documented

### NFR-4: Cost Efficiency
- **NFR-4.1**: Pipeline MUST use GitHub's free CI minutes efficiently
- **NFR-4.2**: Pipeline MUST minimize redundant operations
- **NFR-4.3**: Pipeline MUST use appropriate GitHub runner size (standard)

## Technical Requirements

### TR-1: Runtime Environment
- **TR-1.1**: Pipeline MUST use Node.js version compatible with project
- **TR-1.2**: Pipeline MUST run on Ubuntu Linux (latest LTS)
- **TR-1.3**: Pipeline MUST have access to pnpm package manager
- **TR-1.4**: Pipeline MUST set appropriate working directory

### TR-2: Package Management
- **TR-2.1**: Pipeline MUST respect pnpm-lock.yaml for dependency versions
- **TR-2.2**: Pipeline MUST fail if lockfile is out of sync
- **TR-2.3**: Pipeline MUST not modify package.json or lockfile during execution

### TR-3: Command Execution
- **TR-3.1**: Pipeline MUST execute commands in correct sequence:
  1. Install dependencies
  2. Run lint check
  3. Run type check
  4. Run tests
- **TR-3.2**: Pipeline MUST stop on first failure (fail-fast approach)
- **TR-3.3**: Pipeline MUST capture and report all command output

## Security Requirements

### SR-1: Repository Access
- **SR-1.1**: Workflow MUST only access repository contents (no secrets required)
- **SR-1.2**: Workflow MUST use GitHub's default permissions
- **SR-1.3**: Workflow MUST not expose sensitive information in logs

### SR-2: Dependency Security
- **SR-2.1**: Pipeline MUST only install dependencies from pnpm-lock.yaml
- **SR-2.2**: Pipeline MUST not execute arbitrary code from dependencies during CI
- **SR-2.3**: Pipeline MUST use official GitHub Actions from trusted sources

## Constraints

### C-1: Platform Constraints
- **C-1.1**: MUST use GitHub Actions (no external CI services)
- **C-1.2**: MUST work within GitHub's free tier usage limits
- **C-1.3**: MUST be compatible with public and private repositories

### C-2: Project Constraints
- **C-2.1**: MUST NOT modify existing package.json scripts
- **C-2.2**: MUST NOT interfere with local development workflow
- **C-2.3**: MUST follow existing project conventions and patterns

### C-3: Compatibility Constraints
- **C-3.1**: MUST work with current project dependencies
- **C-3.2**: MUST support Bun runtime project structure
- **C-3.3**: MUST work with Effect TypeScript ecosystem

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- GitHub Actions platform and marketplace
- Node.js runtime in GitHub's CI environment
- pnpm package manager availability
- Ubuntu Linux runner environment

### Internal Dependencies
- Current package.json scripts (lint, typecheck, test)
- Existing ESLint configuration (eslint.config.js)
- TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
- Vitest configuration (vitest.config.ts)
- Project dependencies in pnpm-lock.yaml

## Assumptions

### A-1: Environment Assumptions
- GitHub repository has Actions enabled
- Standard GitHub-hosted runners are sufficient
- Internet connectivity is available for dependency downloads

### A-2: Project Assumptions
- Existing lint/typecheck/test commands work correctly locally
- Project follows standard Node.js/TypeScript conventions
- Dependencies are properly specified in package.json

### A-3: Usage Assumptions
- Developers will check CI status before merging PRs
- Failed CI checks indicate code quality issues that need fixing
- CI pipeline will be the primary quality gate for the project

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Criteria
- All existing project commands pass in CI environment
- Pipeline fails appropriately when code quality issues exist
- Clear feedback provided for all check failures
- No false positives or unnecessary failures

### Secondary Success Criteria
