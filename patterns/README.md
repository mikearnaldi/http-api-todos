- **[http-api.md](./http-api.md)** - HTTP API definition and implementation patterns using Effect platform
- **[layer-composition.md](./layer-composition.md)** - Layer-based dependency injection and service composition patterns  
- **[generic-testing.md](./generic-testing.md)** - General testing patterns with @effect/vitest and Effect ecosystem
- **[http-specific-testing.md](./http-specific-testing.md)** - HTTP API testing patterns with real server integration
- **[portfinder-testing.md](./portfinder-testing.md)** - Reliable HTTP server port assignment with portfinder and unified Context.Tag service

## Usage

Each pattern document includes:
- Core concepts and principles
- Code examples from the implementation
- Best practices and guidelines
- Common pitfalls to avoid

These patterns serve as reference material for future development and help maintain consistency across the codebase.
